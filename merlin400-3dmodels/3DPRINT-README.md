All parts are made in prusament PETG. We use galaxy black and white PETG. 
Alot of the parts are printed using heavily modified gcode to increase strength and gas tightness etc. 
Give it a whirl with prusament PETG.

The big white main block (the manifold) is hard to print and is modified in so many places it gets you dizzy.
